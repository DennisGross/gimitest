Given the following test results log from a reinforcement learning policy evaluation, analyze 
the impact of varying environmental conditions, specifically gravity, on the performance as measured by collected rewards.
Highlight any patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data and suggest possible explanations for the observed results. 
Conclude with recommendations for further testing or adjustments to the policy for improved performance.
Consider factors such as the sensitivity of the RL policy to different parameter values, potential optimal parameter ranges,
and non-linear effects of parameters on task performance.
Use statistical reasoning or data visualization techniques if necessary to support your analysis.
