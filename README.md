# GimiTest
GimiTest offers a platform for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents within a generic OpenAI gym environment.
Users can subsequently evaluate these RL agents using a dedicated testing module.
Based on the evaluation outcomes, GimiTest allows users to either retrain the agents or delve into the reasons behind
their failures using integrated explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques.
